# Project Title
Mall Customer Segmentation

# Project Description
Market Segmentation of customers of a mall with K-means (K selected using the elbow method) and Hierarchial Clustering

# Dataset
[Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) (200 rows)

 S.No |CustomerID  |Gender|  Age| Annual Income (k$)|  Spending Score (1-100)

# Libraries used:
* Data handling/preprocessing:
  * Pandas used to read and process data. 
  * Numpy used to facilitate some data processing (e.g. where() function was used to create dummy variables for categorical variables).
  * Sklearn’s StandardScaler (from the sklearn.preprocessing package) was used to normalize all variables since this is an important prerequisite for clustering.
* Clustering
  * Sklearn.cluster package was used for K-means and Hierarchical (aka Agglomerative) clustering.
  * For Hierarchical clustering, the hierarchy module of Scipy.cluster was also used since this let’s us display the dendrogram
* Evaluating model performance
  * The silhouette score function from the sklearn.metrics package was used to judge the performance of the models.
* Data visualization
  * Seaborn was used to create various histograms, violin plots and scatter graphs to emphasize the distribution of data series and the relationships between them.
  * Matplotlib was used to display multiple plots made by seaborn within one figure, and to plot statistics generated by K-means

# Results:
K-means identified 5 clusters (Silhouette Score = 0.417):  
Cluster 0: people of all ages with high income and low spending  
Cluster 1: older people with mid income and mid spending  
Cluster 2: younger people with low income and high spending  
Cluster 3: mostly older people with low income and low spending  
Cluster 4: younger people with high income and high spending  
  
Hierarchical Clustering identified 7 clusters (Silhouette Score = 0.300):  
Cluster 0: people of all ages with high income and low spending  
Cluster 1: people of all ages with low income and low spending  
Cluster 2: younger people with high income and high spending  
Cluster 3: younger people with mid income and mid spending  
Cluster 4: mid age, mid income, mid spending  
Cluster 5: younger people with low income and high spending  
Cluster 6: older people with mid income and mid spending  
  
Since the silhouette score for K-means is higher, its clusters can be used to chalk out a better marketing strategy.   
For example,
* people in Cluster 2 (young + low income + high spend) can be given discounts through e-vouchers which will be accessible for them and reward their loyalty
* people in Cluster 0 should be surveyed to find out why they are not making purchases despite high income. This could highlight a problem in marketing strategy for these customers
